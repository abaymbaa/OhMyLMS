# Syllabuses: topics, chapters, skills, and the course a syllabus is

Any item in the **Curriculum** tab of the [Content Hub](CONTENT-HUB.md) can be a **syllabus**: Cambridge → IGCSE → Mathematics 0580, or a national grade 11 programme. A syllabus has its **topics**, its **chapters** (skill groups) and its **skills**, it is edited in its own full-page editor, the whole thing can be loaded from a CSV file, and **a syllabus is also a course**. Syllabus names, codes and examples in this page and in the tests are made up to show shapes; they are not syllabus definitions.

## How a syllabus is laid out

```
Cambridge                       framework   ┐
└─ IGCSE                        qualification│ ordinary curriculum items
   └─ Mathematics 0580          subject      ┘  ← switched on as a syllabus (and also a course)
      ├─ 1 Number               topic        ┐ topics: ordinary items beneath the syllabus (optional)
      │  ├─ C1.1 Types of number              ┐ chapters: skill groups (named, coded, ordered)
      │  │   ├─ C1.1.1 Identify natural numbers   ┐ skills (library skills, ordered)
      │  │   └─ C1.1.2 Identify prime numbers     ┘
      │  └─ C1.2 Sets
      └─ 2 Algebra and graphs
```

- **A syllabus is any item.** Open an item with **Edit** and tick **This item is a syllabus**. It saves at once and keeps the item's own type (a "subject" stays a "subject"); it gets a **Syllabus** badge, **its name becomes a link to the syllabus editor**, and the panel offers **Open the syllabus editor**. Items typed "syllabus" before this existed were switched on automatically. A syllabus row in the tree has no **Add child** button: its topics are added in the editor.
- **Topics** are the items beneath the syllabus (a unit, a strand, a paper). A topic is an ordinary curriculum item, so it can be moved and reordered, linked to courses and put in Learning Tracks. They are optional: chapters can sit directly under the syllabus. A CSV import creates them too.
- **Chapters** are the skill groups. A chapter has a name, an optional code and optional notes, and is ordered among the chapters beside it. It sits under the syllabus or under a topic. A chapter given only a code is named by its code. **A chapter is also a chapter of the syllabus's course** (see below).
- **Skills** are placed in chapters, in order. A skill has a name (the learning objective), an optional **code** and optional notes or examples.

The two references this was designed from fit this shape: a Cambridge IGCSE syllabus is topic → coded section (C1.1) → objectives, and the Mongolian grade 11 skill list is chapter (11.1) → skill group (М11.1А) → atomic skill (М11.1А1).

## The syllabus editor

Click a syllabus's **name** in the Curriculum tab (or **Open the syllabus editor** in its panel) to open it at `#/content-hub/curriculum/syllabus/{id}`. It is a full page like the course builder, with **Back** and **Done** on top, and it keeps the Content Hub menu entry highlighted.

- **Left panel**: **Add Chapter**, the number of chapters, and the whole syllabus as a nested outline: the syllabus, its topics, the chapters in them, and the skills in each chapter. Choosing a node opens it. **Open all** and **Close all** help with a long syllabus, and the panel can be folded away. **Add Chapter** puts the new chapter into the topic the selection is in (or into the syllabus) and opens it.
- **Right pane**: whatever is selected.

| You select | The pane shows |
| --- | --- |
| The syllabus | Its name, code, version and description; **the course card**; and its content: chapters and topics, with **Add Content** (Chapter, Topic) |
| A topic | Its name, code and description; the chapters and sub-topics in it; **Add Content** |
| A chapter | Its name, code, notes and which topic it sits under; its skills with **Add Content** (**Skill**, **Skill from the library**, **Lesson, quiz or assignment**); and the lessons, quizzes and assignments attached to the whole chapter |
| A skill | Its learning objective, code, notes and chapter; **In the course** (required or not, and the target); and **what the skill owns**: its lessons and its questions |

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Add chapters or skills quickly | **Add Content → Skill** (or **Chapter**) opens a row that stays open: type the code, Tab, type the name, **Enter**. It adds, empties itself and returns to the code field for the next one |
| Rename or add notes | Type in the title, code or notes and leave the field. It **saves as you leave it** (Enter on a single line; Escape puts the saved text back) and says "Saved" |
| Reorder, move or remove | The **⋯** menu on a row or on the pane's title (Move up, Move down, Delete…, Take out of this chapter), and the **Sits under** / **Chapter** selects to move something elsewhere |
| Attach a lesson, quiz or assignment to a chapter | **Add Content → Lesson, quiz or assignment** on the chapter. Existing content is a reference; new content can be made right in the dialog as a draft |
| Back up or edit in a spreadsheet | The **⋯** menu in the header: **Export CSV** (the layout the importer reads) and **Download CSV template** |
| Import | **Import CSV** in the header |

Deleting a topic asks what happens to the topics and chapters under it. Deleting a chapter asks first and keeps its skills in the library. Taking a skill out of a chapter never deletes the skill. A syllabus that still has chapters cannot be switched back into an ordinary item; remove its chapters first.

Every change is saved on the server first and the screen follows what the server answers, so what you see is what is stored. A change that is refused (a skill code already used in the syllabus, say) shows the reason and changes nothing.

## A syllabus is also a course

Every syllabus has one real course (an ordinary course post), so it is listed in the Content Hub **Catalog** and **Courses** tabs and can be published, priced, enrolled in and put in a Learning Track like any other course. The syllabus owns the structure and the course mirrors it, one way:

| Syllabus | Course |
| --- | --- |
| The syllabus's name | The course title |
| A chapter (skill group), in outline order | A chapter of the course, titled "C1.1 · Types of number" (code and name) |
| A skill in a chapter | A skill (outcome) of the course's learning-program **draft**, in that chapter, in the same order |

- **When the course is made.** When an item is switched on as a syllabus, when an item typed "syllabus" is created, and, for a syllabus that existed before this, the first time its editor is opened. **Update course from syllabus** (the course card, and the header menu) makes it match again. A course is also placed under its syllabus in the curriculum, like any course linked there.
- **Only the draft is written.** Learners see nothing until the course is **published** (the course card's **Publish course** is the catalog's own publish, with its readiness checks and the choice to move enrolled learners). The course itself must also be published for learners to reach it.
- **What the course keeps for itself.** A chapter mirrors a chapter of the syllabus when it carries that chapter's uuid, and only such chapters, and the skills in them, are managed. A chapter, a skill, an attachment, the learning mode, a skill's target and its "required" flag set in the catalog are left alone. A skill new to the course starts at **Proficient** and **not required**.
- **Choosing what the course requires.** The catalog will not publish a skill-based course until at least one skill is **required**, and a required skill needs approved questions (the catalog's own readiness checks, listed in the publish dialog). So the editor lets you decide as skills become ready: a skill's **In the course** block (**Learners must reach this skill to finish the course**, and its **Target**, Proficient or Mastered), and the **✓** menu above a chapter's skills (**Require every skill in this chapter** / **Make every skill in this chapter optional**). Required skills are tagged on the chapter's rows, counted ("3 of 5 required for the course") and totalled on the course card. Only a syllabus skill's requirement and target change; the skills and chapters stay as the syllabus has them.
- **Lessons, quizzes and assignments** are attached to a chapter from the chapter's pane (or to chosen skills in the catalog). They are the course's attachments, so the catalog and the course editor show the same thing.
- **A course may hold every skill of its syllabus** (up to 5,000). An ordinary course's learning program still lists at most 200 skills.
- **Deleting the course** (outside the editor) means the syllabus is given a new one the next time it asks. **Deleting the syllabus** keeps the course and drops the link.
- If the course cannot follow a change, the change to the syllabus still stands and the editor says so; **Update course from syllabus** tries again.

## Skills own their lessons and questions

A skill is a library skill, so what teaches and tests it belongs to the **skill**, not to one syllabus or course. In a skill's pane, **What this skill owns** shows:

- **Lessons**: the lessons tagged to the skill. **Add lesson** finds an existing lesson or writes a new one (a draft) and tags it at once; **Remove** takes it off the skill. Editing a lesson changes it everywhere it is used.
- **Questions**: the questions mapped to the skill in the question bank (written there, not in the editor), with their status.
- **Games, soon**: the pane renders the extension slot `syllabus.skill.resources` (context: `skill`, `syllabus`). A module that adds practice games registers a slot (`registerSlot`, see [EXTENSIONS.md](EXTENSIONS.md)) and its section appears under the questions, with nothing else to change.

## Skills are real library skills

Skills created for a syllabus are ordinary skills in the skill library (Content Hub → **Skills**), so questions, lessons, practice and learner evidence work on them like any other skill.

- Each syllabus has one **root skill** in the library, named after the syllabus, created the first time a skill is added. Its skills are the root's children, so the library tree reads Syllabus → skills, and the same objective text in two syllabuses is two separate skills (skills are never merged by name; use [skill mappings](CURRICULUM-TRACKS.md) to relate them).
- **Names may repeat inside a syllabus** (the same objective in a Core and an Extended section); the **code** tells them apart. **Codes are unique within a syllabus**, ignoring case.
- A skill's name, code and notes are edited in the syllabus; the library shows the same values.
- **Removing a skill from a chapter, or deleting a chapter, never deletes the skill.** It stays in the library with its questions, lessons and evidence. Delete it there if you want it gone.
- An existing library skill can be placed in a chapter (**Add Content → Skill from the library**). It stays one skill; it can be in one chapter per syllabus.

## Importing from CSV

**Import CSV** (in the editor's header) opens a four-step dialog. Nothing is saved until the review is clean.

1. **Choose the file.** UTF-8, comma, semicolon or tab separated (Mongolian and other scripts are fine; save a spreadsheet as "CSV UTF-8"). Up to 5 MB and 5,000 rows per file; split a bigger syllabus into parts.
2. **Tell us what each column holds.** Columns are recognised from their titles ("Skill ID", "Ref", "Atomic Learning Objective", "Chapter", "Topic", "Section code", "Notes and examples" and similar) and you can change any of them. A **Skill** column is required; everything else is optional. Two options help with spreadsheets: *the first row holds column titles*, and *an empty content or group cell repeats the one above it* (for merged cells; only on rows that have a skill, and a group only continues within the same content).
3. **Review.** The file is checked on the server as a dry run: how many contents, skill groups and skills would be **new**, **updated**, **moved** or **unchanged**, plus every problem with its row number. If any row has a problem nothing is imported.
4. **Import.** Applied in one transaction: it either all happens or none of it. The course then follows: a chapter for every skill group and a skill for every skill.

### The columns

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Content code, Content | A topic. A path such as `Paper 1 > 1 Number` nests (the code belongs to the last level). Empty = directly under the syllabus. |
| Skill group code, Skill group name | A chapter. A code with no name names the group. Empty (on a row with a skill) = a chapter called "Skills" under that topic, with a warning. |
| Skill code, Skill | The learning objective and its code. A code with no skill name is an error. |
| Notes | Notes or examples for the skill. |

```csv
content_code,content,group_code,group,skill_code,skill,description
1,Number,C1.1,Types of number,C1.1.1,Identify and use natural numbers,e.g. convert between numbers and words
1,Number,C1.1,Types of number,C1.1.2,Identify and use prime numbers,
11.1,Квадрат тэгшитгэл ба тэнцэтгэл биш,М11.1А,,М11.1А1,Квадрат тэгшитгэлийн графикийг зөв зурах.,
```

### Importing again is safe

An import **never deletes anything**: what the file leaves out stays. Rows are matched to what the syllabus already has:

- a topic, chapter or skill matches by its **code** when both have one, otherwise by its **name** (ignoring case and spacing);
- a skill with a code is found **anywhere in the syllabus**, so a skill whose code now sits under another chapter is **moved**, not duplicated;
- a match whose text differs is **updated** to the file's text (empty notes in the file never blank existing notes);
- the same skill code under two different chapters in one file is an error, and an identical repeated row is ignored with a warning.

So importing the same file twice reports "nothing to import", and a corrected or extended file updates the syllabus in place.

## Where syllabus skills show up

- **Learning Tracks.** A syllabus's skills (and those of its topics) count as the skills of that curriculum item on a learner's track dashboard, and a skill shows the topic it belongs to.
- **Skill library.** Under the syllabus's root skill, with their codes.
- **The course.** As its chapters and skills, in the Content Hub catalog.
- The Curriculum tree shows each syllabus with its course and its number of skill groups (its chapters) and skills.

## REST API (`ohmylms/v1`, administrators only)

All routes are under `curriculum/items/{id}/syllabus` (`{id}` is the syllabus). Every write answers with the syllabus's fresh outline, the item tree and the course summary.

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET …/syllabus` | The outline: contents (the syllabus first, with `depth`), each with `groups` (each with the `chapter_id` of the course chapter it became), each with `skills`; totals; the root skill; the `course` summary (`null` until it exists) |
| `POST …/syllabus/course` | Give the syllabus its course if it has none and make the course match; answers like a write |
| `PUT …/syllabus/course/skills` | Which skills the course requires: `skills` is `[{term_id, required?, target?}]`. Only skills of this syllabus change, and only their requirement and target; answers like a write |
| `POST …/syllabus/groups` | Add a group (`name`, `code`, `description`, `item_id`, `position`) |
| `PUT/DELETE …/groups/{group}` | Edit a group; delete it (a group holding skills needs `confirm`) |
| `POST …/groups/{group}/move` | `item_id` and `position` |
| `POST …/groups/{group}/skills` | Create a skill (`name`, `code`, `description`) or place an existing one (`term_id`) |
| `PUT …/skills/{term}` | Edit a placed skill's name, code or notes |
| `DELETE …/groups/{group}/skills/{term}` | Take a skill out of the group (it stays in the library) |
| `POST …/groups/{group}/skills/{term}/move` | `group_id` and `position` |
| `POST …/syllabus/import` | `rows` and `dry_run`; answers a `report` (counts, `errors`, `warnings`, `applied`) |

Writes also carry `course` (id, title, status, mode, `published`, counts of chapters, skills and attachments, and the addresses of the course settings and catalog) and, when the course could not follow, `course_error`. Items answer with `course_id`. `PUT curriculum/items/{id}` also accepts `is_syllabus`; turning it on, or creating an item typed "syllabus", makes the course, and renaming a syllabus renames its course. Moving or deleting an item that holds chapters brings the course up to date.

What a skill owns uses the skill API: `GET skills/{id}` (its `lessons`), `PUT skills/{id}/lessons` (`lesson_ids`, replaces the set), `GET skills/link-targets?type=lesson`, and `GET question-bank?skill={id}`. The course's attachments use the catalog API (`GET/PUT content-hub/catalog/{course}`); the editor saves only `attachments`, never the skills, which the syllabus owns. Skill names and notes from the skill API (`skills`) and the curriculum skill pickers are returned as plain text (`a > 0`), not as the HTML entities WordPress stores (`a &gt; 0`).

## Storage

Schema version 3 of `OhMyLMS\Curriculum\Schema` (applied on the next page load, safe to repeat): three columns on `ohmylms_curriculum_items` (`is_syllabus`, `skill_root_id`, and `course_id`, the course a syllabus is, 0 until it is made) and two tables, `ohmylms_syllabus_groups` and `ohmylms_syllabus_group_skills` (the ordered placements). Skills themselves are terms of the `ohmylms_skill` taxonomy with the code in `_ohmylms_skill_code`; the root skill is marked with `_ohmylms_syllabus_item`. Deleting a curriculum item removes its groups and placements (and the link to its course; the course stays); deleting a library skill removes its placements.

The course is an ordinary course post with the meta `_ohmylms_syllabus_item` (the syllabus), and each mirrored chapter carries `_ohmylms_syllabus_group` (the uuid of its skill group). The skills are outcomes in the course's learning-program draft.

Skills created here get a short slug of their own. WordPress derives one from the name, which for long names in Cyrillic and similar scripts is URL-encoded and cut at 200 characters; two objectives that begin the same then collide and the insert fails.

## Source

- PHP: `includes/Curriculum/Syllabus.php` (outline, groups, skills, import), `SyllabusCourse.php` (the course a syllabus is: creating it and mirroring chapters and skills, with the planning kept pure), `SyllabusRows.php` (cleans and checks rows), `SyllabusPlan.php` (matches rows against the syllabus and plans the operations; shared by the dry run and the import), controller `includes/Rest/V1/SyllabusController.php`. `Links::object_ids()` and `Links::memberships()` include syllabus skills. `CourseProgram::too_many_outcomes()` lifts the 200-skill limit for a syllabus's course.
- Admin UI: `assets/src/features/curriculum/`. The editor is `SyllabusWorkspace.jsx` (the page and its route component), `WorkspaceSidebar.jsx` (the outline), `TopicPane.jsx`, `ChapterPane.jsx`, `SkillPane.jsx` and `SkillResources.jsx` (the panes), `CoursePanel.jsx`, `WorkspaceParts.jsx` (autosaving fields, quick add, rows, menus), `WorkspaceDialogs.jsx`, `AddContentMenu.jsx`, `useSyllabusWorkspace.js` (loading and guarded changes), `useCourseCatalog.js` (the course's attachments), `workspaceActions.js` (every change), `workspace.mjs` (the pure model: nested outline, selection, ordering). `SyllabusSummary.jsx` is what the item panel shows, `ImportDialog.jsx`, `csv.mjs` (parser, column detection, export), `syllabus.mjs` (helpers) and `download.mjs` are shared. The route is `SYLLABUS_ROUTE` in `assets/src/features/content-hub/hubRoutes.mjs`, wired in `assets/src/extensions/index.jsx`; the page loads lazily from the `curriculum` chunk. Styles are `.ohmylms-ws-*` in `assets/css/admin-ui.css`.

## Validation

```sh
node --test tests/js/workspace.test.mjs tests/js/syllabus.test.mjs tests/js/curriculum.test.mjs tests/js/content-hub.test.mjs
php tests/php/syllabus-unit.php
OHMYLMS_TEST_CREDENTIALS=/path/test-credentials.json php tests/php/syllabus-integration.php
OHMYLMS_TEST_CREDENTIALS=... OHMYLMS_CHROMIUM_PATH=... npx playwright test tests/browser/syllabus.spec.cjs --workers=1
```

The integration suite refuses any database other than `ohmylms_source_test`. It covers the flag and its guard, group and skill editing, equal names and unique codes, maths and Cyrillic text, long names that begin alike, a dry run that changes nothing, an import applied, repeated and edited, a refused file, an import that fails part-way and rolls back (including the library skills it created), the Tracks and membership integration, deletion, permissions, and the course: it is made, named, linked and rebuilt, chapters and skills follow every change (rename, reorder, move, delete, import), what the catalog added by hand survives, more than 200 skills fit, and deleting a syllabus keeps its course. The browser spec opens the editor from the syllabus's name and builds chapters and skills from the keyboard, attaches a lesson to a chapter, tags lessons to a skill, and runs the CSV import and export.

## Known limitations

- PDF syllabuses are not read by the app; they are converted to CSV first (send one to a developer or assistant to convert and review).
- Chapters are not nested inside each other (topics hold chapters), and a skill is in one chapter per syllabus.
- Reordering uses the Move up and Move down menu items, not drag and drop.
- An import never deletes, so removing a skill from a syllabus is done in the editor.
- The course follows the syllabus one way. Chapters, skills and attachments made by hand in the catalog stay, but a skill removed from the syllabus leaves the course, and a skill added to the course by hand that is later placed in a chapter is taken over by it.
- A large syllabus takes a moment longer to save: the course is brought up to date after each change (about 70 ms for a skill added to a 500-skill syllabus, and a second or two for the first sync of a large import).
- A new syllabus course cannot be published until you require a skill and that skill has approved questions; there is no "require everything" shortcut beyond one chapter at a time.
- Lessons attach to a whole chapter in the editor; attaching to chosen skills of the course is done in the catalog. Lessons tagged to a skill belong to the skill, and are not attached to the course automatically.
- Games are not built yet; only the slot for them exists.
- New strings are not yet in `languages/ohmylms.pot`.
